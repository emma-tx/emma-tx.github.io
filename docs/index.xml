      <description>My professional background is in .NET software engineering (C#, MVC, MSSQL, etc), though this is within the context of an ecosystem of other technologies related to deployment, version control, distribution and testing. Aside from that, I do have some expertise with the Linux operating system (mostly variants of Debian and openSUSE), which I have been using since ~2005.
After several years working for the public sector, where I provided technical support for secure communications networks, I decided to take this in a more academic direction, studying computer security at the University of South Wales, and managing to earn a Masters&amp;rsquo; degree in 2014.</description>

      <description>Software Security Azure Static Site Generators Developed using Microsoft Azure services, the static site generators (SSGs) consist of the following:
Azure Functions - These implement the logic, and are roughly analogous to the controller methods in a .NET MVC application. Azure Logic Apps: An event-driven Logic App is responsible for causing the Function App to execute and for processing the output. Generally it&amp;rsquo;s what merges the HTML page templates with the content to be displayed.</description>
