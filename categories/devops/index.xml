      <description>Netlify CMS and Continuous Deployment for Hugo Having experimented with this, I think Netlify&amp;rsquo;s idea of tacking a CMS onto a static site generator is tailored for situations where multiple developers, through Continuous Deployment, are providing a corporate site for which the content is being edited by non-technical users. At least it appears that way, because it takes a lot of work to develop the site and configure the CMS for anything more generic than the template provided, and an individual developer working on this as a personal project would most likely dispense with the CMS entirely and modify the files in the /content directory themselves (I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why).</description>

      <description>Migrations Using Visual Studio SQL Server Database Project Setting Up the Migration Project Add a new project to the Visual Studio solution. This project will initially be empty, without assembly references or scaffold files - it appears everything is native to Visual Studio. To this we need to add the connection to the database the schema is to be imported from. There will be a menu option for &amp;lsquo;Import&amp;rsquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;lsquo;Database&amp;rsquo;.</description>
