      <description>A Docker container runs as a sandboxed process on a local system or a server, and consists of at least one image. An image is built from the source code of an application or service, and can be distributed, through a repository, to provide others the means of testing an existing software product with minimal setup.
Containers and images can be managed through the Docker Dashboard application. As such, a Docker container will require its own configurations and script that enable it to run as intended.</description>
