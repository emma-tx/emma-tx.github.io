      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found the ideal theme for my Hugo site. Mainroad is relatively simple in design, the layout is roughly what I was looking for, and it&amp;rsquo;s easier to customise. It still has tags and categories features that are essential for a site hosting technical documentation. I spent around six hours learning how the template works, re-arranging the content and tweaking the CSS to make it as clean as my MkDocs site.</description>
