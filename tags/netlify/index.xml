      <description>Netlify CMS and Continuous Deployment for Hugo Having experimented with this, I think Netlify&amp;rsquo;s idea of tacking a CMS onto a static site generator is tailored for situations where multiple developers, through Continuous Deployment, are providing a corporate site for which the content is being edited by non-technical users. At least it appears that way, because it takes a lot of work to develop the site and configure the CMS for anything more generic than the template provided, and an individual developer working on this as a personal project would most likely dispense with the CMS entirely and modify the files in the /content directory themselves (I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why).</description>
